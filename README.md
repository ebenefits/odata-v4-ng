# odata-v4-ng

This project is an OData V4 typescript client library for Angular2+. The goal is to create an easy to understand [fluent API](https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjztKLavNTVAhXDKlAKHbNEA2IQFgg2MAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFluent_interface&usg=AFQjCNHcT-89__Mu2BHtejtaB-dxbg7VNw) for querying, creating, updating and deleting OData resources in Angular2+.

To install the package use `npm install --save odata-v4-ng`

**Please do NOT use this project in production till version 1.0.0 (end of September).
This project is still in an alpha stage and the API could change consistently.**
